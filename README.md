## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

<p>
This was a capstone project for a University of Turku <a href="https://tech.utu.fi/fi/full-stack/" rel="noopener">Full Stack bootcamp</a>, which took place between March and August of 2019. A <a href="https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-frontend/graphs/contributors" rel="noopener">team of five</a> was given three months and free hands to design and build it. Original concept and support was provided by <a href="https://www.ambientia.fi/">Ambientia</a>.
</p>

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a recent version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="noopener">Node.js</a> installed.

For this React frontend to work, start the <a href="https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-backend" rel="noopener">backend server</a> on the same machine.

### Installing

Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-frontend.git
cd uftc-frontend
```

Install Node.js modules.

```
npm install
```

Start the application in development mode.

```
npm start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and you should see the login page.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The application is meant to be used by a closed group of people, like a company's employees. Therefore, creating an account works only when you enter the site at http://localhost:3000/login/secret where the term 'secret' matches the one set in the backend .env file for environment variables.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

The application assumes to find the <a href="https://github.com/simosavonen/uftc-backend" rel="noopener">backend server</a> running on the same host. Edit the file 'config/config.js' if this is not the case.

To build a production version.

```
npm run build
```

Copy the contents of the 'build' folder into your web server.
